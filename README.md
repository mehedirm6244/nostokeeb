# NostoKeeb
NostoKeeb [নষ্ট (Bangla): Rotten] is an on screen keyboard program **for X11** written in GTK3

### Why?
Onboard was crashing on LightDM login prompt, locking me out of my computer as my keyboard is broken. So, obviously, I proceeded to write this program instead of actually fixing the issue with Onboard.

## To-do

- [ ] Make `Ctrl`, `Shift` and `Alt` actually useful
- [ ] Add visual indicators for `CapsLock`, `Shift`, `Ctrl` and `Alt`
- [ ] Fix bugs
